## How can I contribute?

You can start by creating a fork of this project, after that just create a branch and enjoy coding! If your token somehow gets leaked, it's not our problem. As a developer you are responsible for keeping your own token and passwords safe. After you're done with your edits just open a pull request and explain what you did and why. Once you're ready for it do be added to the Astolfo-Community bot, ping `ThePrimedTNT#5190` and tell him that your PR is ready to be reviewed. 

## Creating a development settings file

It's as simple as creating a new file `dev.properties` under the `resources` folder and in your run configuration adding `--spring.config.name=dev` to the program arguments.
